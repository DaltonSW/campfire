Make your log files helpful instead of scary and cumbersome.

- Monitor files as they update in real time

![realtime update example](./demo/realtime.gif)

- Filter your files by log type or keyword, hiding things you don't care about

![filtering example](./demo/filtering.gif)

- Continously monitor files by name, whether they exist or not

![file example](./demo/monitoring.gif)

- All of the above at once!

<div align="center">
    <h2>Usage ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>
</div>

- Just run `campfire [file]` with whatever file you want to monitor. That's it!
